# eHousing
A property-listing web-based application for tenants to search prospective properties for renting.
Written in HTML and styled in CSS.It contains some Javascript and the back-end is purely written in PHP.
It runs on a MySQL server.
To use, create a database called 'e-housing' and import and run the e-housing.sql file
This was my third-year project btw. Use with care.

Vamos!
